This will be a place to post the little learning projects
I do from time to time to get the hang of some aspect
of Digital Humanities work. By posting them I hope they'll
be useful to others, but more importantly, it will hold
me responsible for thinking about what I'm doing an 
documenting it properly, so that the learning will stick.

Coming up first: using IIIF annotations to enhance the
manifest for an incunabulum to make its navigation system
(based on marginal article and paragraph numbers) navigable
by online readers.
